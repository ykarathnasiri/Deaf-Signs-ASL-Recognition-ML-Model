# Deaf-Signs-ASL-Recognition-ML-Model
DS intro final ML project
This project successfully developed a real-time hand sign language recognition system using
computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system demonstrates the potential of
leveraging these technologies to bridge the communication gap between sign language users
and non-signers. While the current system showcases promising results, there is still room
for further improvements and extensions to enhance its performance and usability.
